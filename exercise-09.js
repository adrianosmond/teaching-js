/**
 * EXERCISE 09 :: LOOPS ii
 * 
 * In Maths, there is the concept of powers. X to the power of y is x multiplied
 * by itself y times, so 2 to the power of 4 is 2 times 2 times 2 times 2 = 16.
 * 
 * Write a function called powerOf which takes 2 parameters: a number and a
 * number to raise it to the power of, and returns the number raised to the
 * power of the other. e.g.
 * 
 * powerOf(2, 4)
 * 
 * should return 16.
 * 
 * I won't be testing negative powers, but I will test numbers to the power of 0.
 * Any number when raised to the power of 0 is 1.
 * 
 * ðŸ‘‡ Write code in the function below ðŸ‘‡

function powerOf(number, power) {
  
}

/**
 * ðŸ‘† Write code in the function above ðŸ‘†
 * 
 * You can ignore stuff that happens below here. If you change it you'll probably
 * break the ability to test your code, so don't do it!
