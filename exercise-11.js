/**
 * EXERCISE 09 :: INTERVIEW QUESTIONS i / REMAINDERS ii
 * 
 * We're going to take a break from arrays and loops for a bit now. The next couple
 * of tasks will be variants on questions that I've genuinely had in programming
 * interviews. Don't worry though, they aren't that hard and you can definitely
 * do them using the skills you've learned so far. The first is about the game
 * Fizz Buzz: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fizz_buzz
 * 
 * Write a function that takes a number as a parameter, and returns what a player
 * in a game of Fizz Buzz should say if they're at that number. e.g.
 * 
 * fizzBuzz(8) should return 8
 * fizzBuzz(9) should return "Fizz"
 * fizzBuzz(10) should return "Buzz"
 * fizzBuzz(11) should return 11
 * fizzBuzz(12) should return "Fizz"
 * fizzBuzz(13) should return 13
 * fizzBuzz(14) should return 14
 * fizzBuzz(15) should return "Fizz Buzz"
 * fizzBuzz(16) should return 16
 * 
 * ðŸ‘‡ Write code in the function below ðŸ‘‡

function fizzBuzz(number) {

}

/**
 * ðŸ‘† Write code in the function above ðŸ‘†
 * 
 * You can ignore stuff that happens below here. If you change it you'll probably
 * break the ability to test your code, so don't do it!
