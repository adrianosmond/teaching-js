/**
 * EXERCISE 03 :: FUNCTIONS
 * 
 * If you think back to the code you wrote in exercise 2, it wasn't very
 * reusable. Perhaps you would need to calculate the sum of two sets of
 * numbers. Using the techniques we've learned so far we would have
 * to copy and paste the code and change the variable names. Maybe that
 * wouldn't be such a bad thing to do twice, but what if you needed to do
 * it 100 times. 
 * 
 * Often in programming you want to be able to reuse code and for that we
 * have functions: https://www.javascript.com/learn/javascript/functions
 * 
 * In this exercise, write functions for sum, difference, product and 
 * quotient, which take 2 numbers as parameters and return the correct
 * value for each function. If you want to test that your code is working,
 * you can console.log a function like so:
 * 
 * console.log(sum(1, 2))
 * 
 * However, in programming it isn't good practice to leave console.log
 * messages in your code when it's finished, so when you're happy that
 * it works and before you run the tests, remove them!
 * 
 * ðŸ‘‡ Write code anywhere below the next line ðŸ‘‡

/**
 * ðŸ‘† Write code anywhere above the previous line ðŸ‘†
 * 
 * You can ignore stuff that happens below here. If you change it you'll probably
 * break the ability to test your code, so don't do it!
