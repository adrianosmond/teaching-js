/**
 * EXERCISE 08 :: LOOPS
 * 
 * Just like we created functions to stop us having to copy and paste code to
 * do repetitive tasks, loops help us do the same thing. Often in programming
 * you'll need to perform the same action on lots of pieces of data in a
 * dataset. Looping is perfect for this. There are a few different kinds of
 * loops but probably the most common one is called the for loop. Before you
 * learn about for loops, there's one shorthand that you'll see a lot in for
 * loops and that's ++, which adds 1 to a number
 * 
 * Usually you'll see it written after a variable like so (where i is a variable):
 * 
 * i++
 * 
 * That's shorthand for
 * 
 * i = i + 1
 * 
 * Here's a good introduction to for loops:
 * https://www.kompulsa.com/a-guide-to-for-loops-in-javascript/
 * 
 * On to your task! I've created a function below called loopingIsFun. 
 * Write a for loop inside loopingIsFun that calls console.log 1000 times. 
 * The first time it should call it with 1 as a parameter, e.g.:
 * console.log(1)
 * 
 * the second time with 2, e.g.:
 * console.log(2)
 * 
 * the third time with 3, e.g.:
 * console.log(3)
 * 
 * etc, all the way up to the thousandth time, which should call it like so
 * console.log(1000)
 * 
 * ðŸ‘‡ Write code in the function below ðŸ‘‡

function loopingIsFun() {

}

/**
 * ðŸ‘† Write code in the function above ðŸ‘†
 * 
 * You can ignore stuff that happens below here. If you change it you'll probably
 * break the ability to test your code, so don't do it!
