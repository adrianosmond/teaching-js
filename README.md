# Teaching JS

This repo has a number of lessons aimed at teaching JavaScript to beginners. In order to follow the course yourself you'll need to have [NodeJS](https://nodejs.org/) installed on your computer, as well as a code editor and a terminal. I recommend [VS Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/) as it's a decent free editor which has a terminal in it (in VS Code you can open the terminal from the view menu or by pressing Ctrl + `)

# Setup

- Clone this repository
- Open it in your terminal
- Type `npm i` in your terminal and wait for that to finish then you should be ready to begin with exercise 01
