/**
 * EXERCISE 01 :: INTRO
 * 
 * Welcome!
 * 
 * In this first exercise we're going to get you started with your environment.
 * Firstly, there are 2 commands you'll need to know in order to follow this
 * course. The first is: npm start [FILENAME]. This file is exercise-01.js,
 * so you can run the code you write in this file by typing the command:
 * 
 * npm run exercise-01
 * 
 * into your terminal (you don't need to put the .js on the end, although you
 * can if you want to.)
 * 
 * I will write tests for each of these exercises that make sure the code you've
 * written does what it's supposed to. You can run these tests by typing
 * npm test [FILENAME], so to test the code you've written type:
 * 
 * npm test exercise-01
 * 
 * into your terminal. If you did it correctly you should get a nice green 
 * message telling you that the tests passed. If not, you'll probably get a 
 * red message telling you what went wrong.
 * 
 * For this intro exercise we're going to use console.log() to print messages into
 * your terminal. Things you put inbetween the brackets will get put on the screen
 * so you can use it like so:
 * 
 * console.log("Hello world!")
 * 
 * This will put the text (which is called a String in programming, you can read
 * more about that here: https://www.javascript.com/learn/javascript/strings) that
 * is between the quotes on the screen.
 * 
 * You can also print out numbers (https://www.javascript.com/learn/javascript/numbers)
 * like so:
 * 
 * console.log(1.2345)
 * 
 * And you can print out more than one thing at a time by separating the things you
 * want to print with commas:
 * 
 * console.log(1, "Second", 3)
 * 
 * To pass this test write 3 console.logs. The first should say "I like programming"
 * the second should be the number 10, and the third should have the text "Pi is" AND
 * Pi to 5 decimal places... Good luck!
 * 
 * ðŸ‘‡ Write code anywhere below the next line ðŸ‘‡
