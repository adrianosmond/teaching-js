/**
 * EXERCISE 02 :: VARIABLES
 * 
 * Now we're going to learn about variables, which let you save data
 * to use later. They're fundamental in all programming languages and 
 * in JS you create them using the var keyword. You can read more about
 * that here: https://www.javascript.com/learn/javascript/variables
 * 
 * In this exercise you're also going to do some basic maths. You'll
 * need the basic mathematic operators, which are as follows:
 * 
 * addition:        +
 *
 *    e.g.    1 + 2
 * 
 *
 * subtraction:     -
 *
 *    e.g.    10 - 9
 * 
 *
 * multiplication:  *
 *
 *    e.g.    3 * 4
 *
 *
 * division:        /
 * 
 *    e.g.    15 / 3
 * 
 *
 * Write a program that creates a varible called x which has a value of 12
 * and a variable called y which has a value of 6
 * 
 * Then create four more variables:
 *    sum, which should have a value equal to x + y
 *    difference, which should have a value equal to x - y
 *    product, which should have a value equal to x * y
 *    quotient, which should have a value equal to x / y
 * 
 * console.log these last four variables in the order that they're listed
 * above in four separate lines
 * 
 * ðŸ‘‡ Write code anywhere below the next line ðŸ‘‡

/**
 * ðŸ‘† Write code anywhere above the previous line ðŸ‘†
 * 
 * You can ignore stuff that happens below here. If you change it you'll probably
 * break the ability to test your code, so don't do it!
 *
